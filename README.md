# CapellixLCD
This is a desktop app that controls the Capellix cooler's LCD instead of iCUE.

A physical manifestation of my deeply rooted hate for Corsair's software solutions.

## Dependencies:
- libusb
- pyusb
## Installation:
WIP. Please wait for this to actually be a feasible software solutions to daily drive this.
## What it does and what it doesn't do.
- [x] Display a static image to the LCD.
- [ ] Read data from system sensors.
- [ ] Display that data.
- [ ] Have a GUI.
- [ ] Have theme support.
- [ ] A bunch of other stuff I'll probably come up with while developing this.
